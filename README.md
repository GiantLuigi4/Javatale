# Javatale

An undertale fangame engine built in java, which supports multiple programming languages.

​

Here's a list of everything currently supported:

-Java

-Groovy

-Kotlin (I think, I don't have much of a way to test this one)

​

And I plan to support

-LUA (which caused me to make this, because I don't like LUA)

-Python (which will likely require me to make my own interpreter because Jython is wierd and doesn't work properly afaik)

​

This will probably always be at least slightly worse than unitale/cyf, but hey. At least I don't need LUA.
